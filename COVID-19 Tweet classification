# COVID-19-Tweet-Classification-Challenge-by-ZindiWeekendz

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. 
This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on key words like ‘covid’ or ‘coronavirus’ being present,
allowing researchers and engineers to gather a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.

This model could be put into practice as part of a larger effort to understand online sentiment around COVID-19, 
and inform future communications and public interventions by governments and non-government public health organisations.

The data used for this challenge has been collected by the Zindi team via Twitter API from tweets over the past year. 
The are ~7,000 tweets in the train set and ~3,000 in the test set.
